    <h2>Pye is a good, old cat.</h2>
    <p>We inherited Pye when he was 15.</p>
    <p>Pye is an anomoly, because of his health.</p>
    <p>He is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_cat">Siamese cat.</a></p>
    <p>He has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bad teeth</li>
        <li>An <em>undifferentiated</em> heart problem</li>
        <li><em>Moderate</em> kidney failure</li>
        <li>Anorexia</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The vets he's seen <strong>can't figure out</strong> why he's still alive.</p>
    <p>Because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>His heart condition makes it so <em>we can't treat his kidneys</em></li>
        <li>His kidney condition makes it so <em>we can't treat his heart</em></li>
        <li>It all makes it so <em>he won't eat</em></li>
      </ol>
    <p>But he does because the bad parts also fix the good parts.</p>
    <img src="http://clipart-library.com/images/8izKLz7eT.jpg">
    <p>The high blood pressure pushes the blood faster through the kidneys, so the impurities don't stick.<p>
    <p>The kidneys dehydrate him so less fluid can back up into his chest to bother his heart.</p>
